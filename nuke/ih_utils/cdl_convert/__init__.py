CDL Convert
===========

Converts between common ASC CDL (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASC_CDL)
formats. The American Society of Cinematographers Color Decision List (ASC CDL,
or CDL for short) is a schema to simplify the process of interchanging color
data between various programs and facilities.

The ASC has defined schemas for including the 10 basic numbers in 5 different
formats:

* Avid Log Exchange (ALE)
* Film Log EDL Exchange (FLEx)
* CMX EDL
* XML Color Correction (cc)
* XML Color Correction Collection (ccc)
* XML Color Decision List (cdl)

Unofficial Formats:

* OCIOCDLTransform, a Foundry Nuke node
* Space Separated CDL, a Rhythm and Hues cdl format

It is the purpose of CDLConvert to convert ASC CDL information between these
basic formats to further facilitate the ease of exchange of color data within
the Film and TV industries.

`cdl_convert` supports parsing ALE, FLEx, CC, CCC, CDL and RCDL. We can write
out CC, CCC, CDL and RCDL.

**CDLConvert is not associated with the American Society of Cinematographers**

## Public Functions
